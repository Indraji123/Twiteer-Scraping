This project is a Twitter Scraper web app built with Streamlit, Python, and the snscrape library. 
It allows users to input a Twitter username, date range, and tweet limit to scrape tweets from the specified account. 
The scraped data, including tweet content, date, and URL, is displayed in the app and can be downloaded as a CSV file. 
The intuitive interface makes it easy for users to access Twitter data without any coding knowledge.
